The repo contains three Colab notebooks:
1. **Labels & Categories Model**: main notebook. Defines the hierarchical Bayesian model described in the paper.
2. Labels & Categories Results: code to generate results figures & tables.
3. Labels & Categories Method Figures: code to generate supporting methods figures. 

Directories:
- figures

- stats: R markdown file defining the linear mixed effect models run on the outputs
- tables: participant simulation outputs
